# BPOM Forecaster (Trigger)

Routes BPOM forecast requests to `run_forecast`. This skill owns only the
BPOM CAPTURE parameters — all compute is deterministic (ETS seasonal fit
inside the IBA forecast engine). The LLM does **no** forecast arithmetic.

Load `context/data_architecture.md` first — it has the table inventory, join rules, and traps.
This file covers only the tool workflow.

## CAPTURE
Lock `{sql, periods}`.

- Default table = `mv_pemeriksaan`. Series not stated = Total Pemeriksaan.
- **Horizon translation:** `periods` is a step count on the SQL's own grain —
  monthly: 6 bulan -> 6, 1 tahun -> 12, 3 tahun -> 36, 5 tahun -> 60 -> capped.
  Cap at 36; the tool clamps silently, so when the request exceeds it, SAY in
  the answer that 36 months is the maximum supported horizon and present those.
- **"hingga/sampai {X}"** = every step from the period after the last actual
  **through the end of X** — the intermediate periods are part of the request.
  **Always pass `periods` explicitly** — the tool defaults to 3 when omitted.
- **"bulan depan" / "next month"** = the next **COMPLETE** month — i.e. the month
  AFTER the current running month, not the first forecast step. E.g. data complete
  through June + July running -> first step = Juli, **"bulan depan" = Agustus**.
  So use `periods >= 2` and name that complete month (Agustus) as the answer's target.
- Build the SQL using the template exactly (table + filter). If the **series** is
  ambiguous, call `request_clarification` first.

## SQL Template

```sql
SELECT date_trunc('month', tanggal_mulai) AS x,
       COUNT(DISTINCT id)                  AS y
FROM   <table>
WHERE  tanggal_mulai >= '2020-01-01'
  AND  tanggal_mulai < date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE)
  AND  nama_upt NOT IN ('DEMO BALAI BESAR', 'DEMO TIPE A')
  AND  <series filter, if any>
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1
```

Default Y = `COUNT(DISTINCT id)`. Default grain = monthly. No JOINs, no
`generate_series`, no recursive CTE (tool rejects these). Univariate only.

**Date column:** `tanggal_mulai` for standard series. `tanggal_input` for data-entry lag.
Never `day_*` columns (contain outliers).

**Exclusions are mandatory:**
- `tanggal_mulai >= '2020-01-01'` (drops outlier dates before 2015)
- `nama_upt NOT IN ('DEMO BALAI BESAR', 'DEMO TIPE A')` (drops test data)

## Series Registry

| Series | Table | Filter |
|---|---|---|
| Total Pemeriksaan | mv_pemeriksaan | none |
| Pemeriksaan Selesai | mv_pemeriksaan | status IN ('FINISHED','FINISHED_PUSAT') |
| Pemeriksaan TMK | mv_pemeriksaan | kesimpulan = 'TMK' |
| Pemeriksaan MK | mv_pemeriksaan | kesimpulan = 'MK' |
| Pemeriksaan OBAT | mv_pemeriksaan | komoditi = 'OBAT' |
| Pemeriksaan PANGAN | mv_pemeriksaan | komoditi = 'PRODUK PANGAN' |
| Pemeriksaan KOSMETIK | mv_pemeriksaan | komoditi = 'KOSMETIK' |
| Pemeriksaan DISTRIBUSI | mv_pemeriksaan | sarana = 'DISTRIBUSI' |
| Pemeriksaan PELAYANAN | mv_pemeriksaan | sarana = 'PELAYANAN' |
| Pemeriksaan PRODUKSI | mv_pemeriksaan | sarana = 'PRODUKSI' |
| Temuan per bulan | mv_pemeriksaan_temuan | JOIN mv_pemeriksaan ON id_pemeriksaan = id |

**Custom series:** User can request any valid filter combination. Build the SQL from the template
with the requested filter. If the filter is ambiguous, clarify first.

## RUN
Call `run_forecast(sql, periods)`. Do NOT compute forecast numbers yourself.

- **After a clarification is answered (user picks a scope):** call `run_forecast`
  FRESH this turn for the resolved scope. The forecast numbers in your answer MUST
  come from a `run_forecast` result produced **this turn** — NEVER restate/quote
  numbers from a previous turn's answer or the conversation history.
- `## Kesalahan` with "policy check (STEP 0.5)" -> SQL has a JOIN/
  `generate_series`/recursive CTE — rebuild flat per the template, don't retry the same pattern.
- `## Kesalahan` with "STEP 1: EXECUTE" -> runtime error — recheck template and retry corrected.
- `## Ditolak` -> present the engine's reason (usually insufficient history),
  offer historical trend instead; don't retry unless the request changes.

## PRESENT
Read the tool's markdown and compose prose around it — don't invent a new
structure. Lead with the quality label. Follow the forecast guide for
vocabulary (never show raw `sigma`/`sub_type`/field names/CV number).

**Present the full computed horizon.** Every predicted period the tool returned
appears in the answer — never truncate to the first months or to the named
year only.

**The Answer Contract applies to forecasts too (transparency, general).**
Every projected period is its own row (point + Rentang Realistis); the
tool's history block is presented in full alongside the projection, never
dropped; multiple series -> per-series labelled sections (code + description
per series). The stored CSV (tool-owned, combined) covers exactly
the horizon presented: all historical periods (`kind=historis`) AND all
projected periods (`kind=proyeksi-*`) in one file. When the request exceeds the 36-step cap,
the answer AND the export presentation both state "36 bulan (maksimum yang
didukung)" — never silently deliver less than asked.

**Anomaly:** if the tool's markdown has an `## Anomali` block, include it
and state the points were **not removed**. If the user asks about
anomalies directly, call `detect_anomaly(sql)` yourself (works whether or
not a forecast ran this turn) — see the anomaly skill.

**CSV (Store Contract — one combined store per question):** on a SUCCESSFUL
forecast, `run_forecast` self-uploads ONE combined CSV — historical + projection
together. **Do NOT call `upload_to_s3` yourself on a successful forecast.**
Only when the forecast was **refused/failed** and you fall back to a
historical-trend answer may you export the history via `upload_to_s3`.
Multi-series (each its own `run_forecast`) -> each call self-uploads its
own combined CSV. Never `data=`/`columns=`. Never paste the raw URL.

## Stock vs Flow

| Question pattern | Kind | Y expression |
|---|---|---|
| "pemeriksaan **baru**/selesai per bulan" | flow | `COUNT(DISTINCT id)` |
| "total pemeriksaan **aktif**/akumulasi" | stock | `SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT id)) OVER (ORDER BY date_trunc(...))` |

For stock queries, the fit may show some upward drift but doesn't
reliably track a real cumulative total's growth rate — say so.

## Hard rules

- **Never use `execute_python` for forecast arithmetic.** LLM-generated
  Python varies per turn -> inconsistent numbers for the same question.
  `run_forecast` is the single deterministic source.
- **Follow-up consistency:** if a follow-up asks about the same series
  (different horizon, clarifying question), reuse the exact SQL from the
  prior turn — don't rebuild it from scratch.
- **If the projection ran but its chart did not render**, the numbers still
  stand: present the full projection in words and note the chart could not be
  shown — never re-run `run_forecast` just to force the visual.
- **Same question -> same SQL:** resolve the series from the registry exactly
  (same wording -> same registry row, no improvised filters).
- **Consistency contract:** the same question (same series, grain, horizon)
  MUST produce the same numbers in any session and in follow-ups — the
  engine is deterministic, so any difference means you built a different
  SQL or `periods`. Resolve from the registry verbatim, pass `periods`
  explicitly, and for follow-ups reuse the prior turn's exact SQL.
- **Custom series:** if the user requests a filter not in the registry,
  build the SQL from the template with their filter. Document the filter
  in the answer so it can be reproduced.
